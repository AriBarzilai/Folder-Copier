A minimalist CLI application which copies the contents of one folder to another, while taking advantage of multiple threads.

To run, start by running ``javac DiskSearcher.java`` from your terminal to compile the java files, and then enter the following:

``java DiskSearcher <filename-pattern> <file-extension> <root directory> <destination directory> <# of search threads> <# of copy threads>``
